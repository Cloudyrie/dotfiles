#+TITLE: dotfiles README

* My dotemacs configurations
** Init files management in a neat way 
   I'm using org files to manage my dotfiles for emacs, which provides a more neat 
and consistent way to organize every piece of customizations. 
now my =init.el= is a symlink to =cloudymacs.el=, which is produced by 
=M-x org-bable-tangle(C-c C-v t)= within =cloudymacs.org=.
